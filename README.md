# urbapp

urbapp is just a simple CLI to help you quickly create apps on Urban Airship. Our iOS dev does this a lot so this will help him out. And it's always fun to automate stuff ;-)
It returns App

Example:
	
	./urbapp new --username myUsern0me --password P0ny --name "Awesome Pocahontas" --certificate /path/to/certificate.cer --certificate-password mySecretC3rt --headless

Terminal output:

	-------------------------------------------
	App Key: kAWIDb29udniawd2
	App Secret: kadin12dinaiwd9WAINOw
	App Master Secret ajkwdnw91d012QWdwadAWDw
	-------------------------------------------

## Extra
I've also included [headless](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless) so that if you are running an application using X (most apps on *nix, a few on OSX) it will run in the background.
